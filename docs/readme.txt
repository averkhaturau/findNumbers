This code demonstrates a Qt QML X-platform approach of development apps for
Android, iOS, Windows,  Mac OS X, and Linux platforms.

I test it on Windows and Android 4, so, if you experience some issues on
build / running on some other versions / OSes, please let me know.

The code goes by default with LGPLv3. Other king of licensing is negotiable.
